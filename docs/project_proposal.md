# Introduction
Our project focuses on developing a user-friendly web and mobile application for unit conversions between Imperial and Metric systems. This tool will allow users to input values and receive instant converted outputs for different types of measurements, such as distance, weight, temperature, and more. The app will also feature a location-based suggestion that recommends which system to use based on the userâ€™s country.

The app will provide an accessible experience for users, featuring a toggle between dark and light modes depending on the time of day or user preference. Our goal is to ensure a smooth, responsive experience across all platforms, and we plan to include additional resources like articles, facts, statistics, and information on the history of measurement systems.

**Key Features:**
- Unit conversion (distance, weight, temperature, etc.)
- Location-based system suggestions
- Dark mode/bright mode toggle
- Responsive web and mobile versions
- Accessibility features like adjustable font size
- Informative articles on lesser-known measurement systems


# Anticipated Technologies
We anticipate using the following technologies and tools to develop this project:
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript** for the frontend design and interactivity.
- **Flask (Python)** for backend development to handle conversion logic and APIs.
- **Requests library (Python)** for retrieving location data using the ipinfo API.
- **Git** for version control.
- **VS Code** as the main IDE for development.

# Method/Approach

Our approach will involve breaking the project down into key components:

1. **Frontend Design:**
   - We will begin by creating the structure and layout of the web and mobile versions using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
   - Incorporating the dark/bright mode toggle feature.

2. **Backend Logic:**
   - we plan to Develop the conversion logic using Python, ensuring it handles multiple types of measurements.
   - Implementing location-based system suggestions by integrating the ipinfo API.

3. **Testing & Debugging:**
   - Performing unit testing on the conversion functions and testing the app on different devices to ensure compatibility.

4. **Deployment:**
   - We will deploy the app using platforms such as Heroku or any other hosting platform for public access.

# Estimated Timeline
- **October 7-20:**
  - Design and structure the frontend (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript).
  - Implement the dark/bright mode feature.
  
- **October 21 - November 3:**
  - Develop backend conversion logic (Python).
  - Set up APIs for location-based suggestions.

- **November 4-17:**
  - Integrate the frontend and backend.
  - Test the functionality and fix any bugs.

- **November 18 - Finals:**
  - Finalize features, clean up the code, and ensure accessibility.
  - Deploy the web and mobile versions.


# Anticipated Problems
- **API Integration:** There might be challenges in integrating the ipinfo API for location-based suggestions.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Ensuring a smooth experience on both web and mobile versions could be difficult, especially with responsive design.
- **Performance Optimization:** The app must run efficiently while handling multiple unit conversions without slowing down.
- **Testing:** Conducting extensive testing across devices and browsers to ensure functionality remains consistent.
